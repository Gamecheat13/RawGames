    dialog::add("dolo_of_course_i_couldn_0","vox_zzur_21_01_002_dolo");//Of course, I couldn't always do that. So I created Kane, a human form I could take on Earth. Someone who'd nudge you in the right direction.

    dialog::add("dolo_no_humanity_is_insa_0","vox_zzur_23_01_007_dolo");//Oh my, now that you mentioned it, I hadn't thought of that. I guess I'll just have to kill all of them.  (evil giggle) Run... run while you can, little brother.

    dialog::add("dolo_you_know_if_you_def_0","vox_zzur_25_01_000_dolo");//You know, even if you kill Deimos, you can't go home. The gateway to Earth is sealed, you're trapped here. (GIGGLES) I hope that's not... inconvenient.

    dialog::add("deim_i_needed_to_separate_0","vox_zzur_1_02_001_deim");//I needed to separate you from your 'Guardian Angel', Kane. I didn't have control over her... and she was pulling my power from you. That would come later. (beat) I'd taken Coalescence Headquarters, surrounding it with an impenetrable armada. Except for you. I was waiting. I was still curious, I was in your head, but I couldn't take control. I wanted, no, I needed, to know how before I opened the gateway.
    dialog::add("deim_but_before_that_you_1","vox_zzur_1_02_002_deim");//But before that you had to get through my undead army.

    dialog::add("dolo_humans_have_no_voice_0","vox_zzur_9_02_004_dolo");//Humans have no voice in this place, and how could they? But as it happens, this is not Hendricks... merely a reflection of your conscious... It's how our realm manifests itself to mortals.

There is nothing to be gained by trying to convey your anger, without your voice you are nothing!  (frustrated) I suppose if you insist on attempting to speak, with your futile, pathetic pantomiming I can't stop you. I may as let you wear yourself out.  (SIGHS) But your task was so simple: build me my machine so I could open the gateway, not trap me on the other side! You've lost me my army, I needed my army. Now how do I fight her??
    dialog::add("plyz_hello_who_s_there_0","vox_zzur_9_02_018_plyz");//Hello?? Who's there?? Where am I??

    dialog::add("deim_of_course_not_of_co_0","vox_zzur_9_02_025_deim");//Of course not, of course the mortal cannot speak. Their voice is meaningless and insignificant, why would we cater to their wants and wills when they shouldn't be here?

    dialog::add("deim_and_yet_we_have_anot_0","vox_zzur_9_02_029_deim");//And yet we have another voiceless mortal. I can do little with you. I should not be here, This wasn't the plan. I was to open the gateway, not pass through it.  (beat) And still you can't speak. You move your mouth like a child but you DO NOT SPEAK.
    dialog::add("deim_and_still_you_live_0","vox_zzur_13_02_000_deim");//And still you live?? You just won't die. How many times can I lead you to death only for you to walk away unscathed??
