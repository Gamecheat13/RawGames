    dialog::add("plyz_getting_in_was_easy_0","vox_zbio_1_01_000_plyz");//Getting in was easy. Getting out would be another matter entirely.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_d_worried_about_b_0","vox_zbio_2_01_000_plyz");//We had a robot squad in place, ready if the situation took a turn.  (beat) Goh Xiulan bolted before our robots got her, she was headed for the server room in Cloud Mountain. The only place we could put in the call from transport.
    dialog::add("plyz_it_became_quickly_ap_0","vox_zbio_2_01_001_plyz");//It became quickly apparent that uninvited guests had joined the party in the Biodomes. The dead were flooding into this safe haven.
    dialog::add("plyz_it_was_about_to_beco_0","vox_zbio_2_01_002_plyz");//It was about to become hell on earth.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_had_to_move_we_h_0","vox_zbio_2_01_003_plyz");//We had to move. We had to get to Cloud Mountain.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_don_t_know_how_the_0","vox_zbio_4_01_000_plyz");//I don't know how the undead got in. A forgotten open gate, a child mistake, a poorly-nailed board over a window, it didn't matter. It was spreading fast. We were already outnumbered twenty to one, the remaining humans scrambling away or locked in their homes.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_heard_that_famili_0","vox_zbio_5_01_000_plyz");//We heard that familiar screech. Parasites, mutated creatures born out of 61-15, were flying toward us.
    dialog::add("plyz_with_the_shipping_ya_0","vox_zbio_6_01_000_plyz");//With the shipping yard cleared, Cloud Mountain was just ahead, the Server Room at the top.  (beat) We had a long climb ahead of us.
    dialog::add("plyz_it_sounded_crazy_bu_0","vox_zbio_9_01_002_plyz");//It didn't make any sense. Sure, we weren't on the best of terms, but... this wasn't her. Something else made her do it. Something was controlling her. (SIGHS) The encryption used a biometric hand-scan. Hendricks tried to unlock it.
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_tried_to_g_0","vox_zbio_9_01_003_plyz");//But the Goh Siblings were smart. They'd set up an access system requiring both of their hands for authorization. And her brother was shredded with bullets back in the bar.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_could_hear_the_ho_0","vox_zbio_9_01_005_plyz");//We could hear the horde coming... we didn't have much time. And we only had one sibling.
    dialog::add("plyz_but_she_did_have_two_0","vox_zbio_9_01_006_plyz");//But she did have two hands.
    dialog::add("salm_you_cut_off_her_hand_0","vox_zbio_9_01_007_salm");//You chose to cut off her hand. Why?
    dialog::add("plyz_i_took_a_gamble_i_h_0","vox_zbio_9_01_008_plyz");//I hoped the biometrics were interchangeable, allowing the siblings to use either reader. If we were calling transport and getting out alive, it had to work.
    dialog::add("plyz_and_it_did_0","vox_zbio_9_01_012_plyz");//Lucky for us, it did. Hendricks interfaced with the system.
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_interfaced_0","vox_zbio_10_01_000_plyz");//He was able to raise WA Command, we needed a ride out ASAP. They had a VTOL a few minutes out, rendezvous was set for the top of the dome.  (beat) But Hendricks wanted to know what Goh Xiulan had on Taylor, anything, even the smallest detail could be helpful in picking up his trail... that would take some time.
    dialog::add("plyz_finding_out_what_goh_0","vox_zbio_10_01_002_plyz");//And time was something we didn't have. Hendricks searched the archives -- I dealt with the incoming horde.
    dialog::add("plyz_our_pick_up_was_in_p_0","vox_zbio_12_01_000_plyz");//Our pick up was in position. It was time to get the hell outta here.
    dialog::add("plyz_only_a_few_more_seco_0","vox_zbio_12_01_001_plyz");//Only a few more seconds...
    dialog::add("plyz_we_had_to_haul_ass_a_0","vox_zbio_13_01_000_plyz");//We had to haul ass and stay outta sight.
    dialog::add("plyz_but_they_weren_t_our_0","vox_zbio_13_01_001_plyz");//But they weren't our only concern. Winslow Accord picked up chatter ahead, apparently we weren't the only humans using the docks to escape.
    dialog::add("plyz_from_the_sound_of_it_0","vox_zbio_14_01_000_plyz");//From the sound of it they wanted us dead as much as the flesh-eaters.
    dialog::add("plyz_looked_like_we_were_0","vox_zbio_14_01_001_plyz");//Looked like we were jumping from one bad situation into another..
    dialog::add("plyz_with_in_those_flesh_0","vox_zbio_15_01_000_plyz");//Between the flesh-eaters and that Wraith eyeing us, the Supertrees would be no walk in the park.
    dialog::add("plyz_and_that_hunter_stil_0","vox_zbio_15_01_001_plyz");//And that Rogue Wraith wasn't done with us yet.
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_commandeer_0","vox_zbio_15_01_002_plyz");//Hendricks commandeered an airboat and set the autopilot. We had undead on our ass and more 54i ahead.
    dialog::add("salm_but_you_escaped_0","vox_zbio_16_01_000_salm");//But you escaped?
    dialog::add("plyz_lady_luck_was_our_fr_0","vox_zbio_16_01_001_plyz");//The Wraith tried to make good work of us, they're pretty determined malfunctioning scraps of metal.
    dialog::add("plyz_but_technically_so_w_0","vox_zbio_16_01_002_plyz");//But technically so were we.
    dialog::add("plyz_our_exfil_was_just_a_0","vox_zbio_16_01_003_plyz");//Our exfil was just ahead. We were getting out of Singapore.
    dialog::add("salm_what_about_taylor_w_0","vox_zbio_16_01_004_salm");//What about Taylor? What did Hendricks learn from the server?
    dialog::add("plyz_nothing_it_had_been_0","vox_zbio_16_01_005_plyz");//Nothing. It had been wiped. The information loss. (defeated) Taylor was in the wind. And the virus... 61-15 wouldn't stop this time. The Winslow Accord and CDP had been thrown into chaos, we'd lost Hong Kong, Berlin, and Cairo, and it was just getting started.  (beat) What would come next, how the world would change, there was no way to be ready for that...
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_had_a_cont_0","vox_zbio_1_02_000_plyz");//Hendricks had a contact, Danny Li. He was slimy as they come, but he could get us transport.
    dialog::add("plyz_at_the_time_the_biod_0","vox_zbio_1_02_001_plyz");//At the time the Biodomes were the safest place to be. With the Outbreak of 2060 the Immortals didn't see tragedy, they saw opportunity. They seized the Marina and dug their heels in. The Biodomes were impenetrable. Dead-proof.
    dialog::add("plyz_not_only_that_they_0","vox_zbio_1_02_003_plyz");//Not only that, Taylor had beaten us out of the Biodomes... and Danny claimed to know where he was heading.
    dialog::add("salm_they_had_this_inform_0","vox_zbio_1_02_004_salm");//They had this information?
    dialog::add("plyz_they_claimed_to_dan_0","vox_zbio_1_02_005_plyz");//Danny was convinced Goh Xiulan had info on her central server. They were doing us a solid, really. (beat) But that didn't come cheap. They wanted food, water, weapons, reinforcements from the Winslow Accord. We agreed to their terms with no idea if we could honor it, The Immortals were a people of their word... and quite efficient in punishing those who did not act the same.
    dialog::add("plyz_still_didn_t_mean_t_0","vox_zbio_1_02_007_plyz");//Danny was in a bad mood, the Immortals weren't exactly happy to see us. They knew our part in what had happened in Coalescence. Danny went so far as to accuse us of opening the containment zones ourselves. Hendricks persuaded him otherwise.
    dialog::add("plyz_but_that_didn_t_chan_0","vox_zbio_1_02_008_plyz");//But that didn't change how I felt. We were there, we had our chance to stop Diaz in the server room...
    dialog::add("salm_you_cannot_blame_you_0","vox_zbio_1_02_009_salm");//You cannot blame yourself for what is out of your control.
    dialog::add("salm_there_were_powers_in_0","vox_zbio_1_02_012_salm");//There were powers in play far greater than your own. Powers with far more control. You were a pawn in his game.
    dialog::add("plyz_you_mean_deimos_0","vox_zbio_1_02_013_plyz");//You mean Deimos...  (beat) Well, as it turns out we weren't his only pawns in the room.
    dialog::add("salm_how_do_you_mean_0","vox_zbio_1_02_014_salm");//How do you mean?
    dialog::add("plyz_know_that_saying_to_0","vox_zbio_1_02_015_plyz");//You can get us a ride out? Sure. I'll give you that. But claiming to know where Taylor was?... Know that saying 'too good to be true'? Something was wrong. There was something malevolent, malicious. I called Danny out. (beat) He wasn't too happy with that. But then again, we assumed he was just scared. The outbreak now occurring world-wide was unprecedented, we were all scared. Up 'til now we'd become complacent, we got comfortable. The dead had stayed in  their cage, and we kept pretending nothing had happened.  (beat) Taylor and Diaz changed that. Pandemonium, riots, civil war, countries were already tearing themselves apart, in many cases before the dead reached them. (beat) But Danny wasn't scared. He was stalling. And it only took us another moment to find out why.
    dialog::add("salm_the_goh_siblings_da_0","vox_zbio_1_02_016_salm");//The Goh Siblings. Danny set you up?
    dialog::add("plyz_no_no_no_this_was_0","vox_zbio_1_02_017_plyz");//No, no, no, this was different. It was their eyes. Hollow, empty, void of life, like they could see right through me. They all had it. Just like Diaz. (beat) It was only later we found out all higher-ups in the Immortals were outfitted with DNI. Like us. If only we'd known the part our own technology would play...
    dialog::add("salm_what_was_it_what_di_0","vox_zbio_1_02_018_salm");//What was it? What did you see?
    dialog::add("plyz_certainly_explained_0","vox_zbio_1_02_020_plyz");//Then we heard that name again. Deimos, Deity of Dread and Terror. (beat) The Goh Siblings pledged to sacrifice us in his honor.
    dialog::add("plyz_thing_about_deadkill_0","vox_zbio_1_02_021_plyz");//Thing about Deadkillers though: there's always a Plan B.
    dialog::add("salm_what_happened_in_the_0","vox_zbio_9_02_000_salm");//What happened in the server room?
    dialog::add("plyz_by_the_time_we_got_t_0","vox_zbio_9_02_001_plyz");//By the time we got there, Goh Xiulan encrypted her hardware, locking us out of the central server.  (beat) Hendricks stepped in, but we were a few seconds too late. Damage was done.
    dialog::add("salm_why_did_she_lock_you_0","vox_zbio_9_02_002_salm");//Why did she lock you out?
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_extracted_0","vox_zbio_10_02_000_plyz");//Hendricks had pulled all the data he could, I hoped it was enough.
    dialog::add("plyz_our_bird_wasn_t_alon_0","vox_zbio_12_02_000_plyz");//Our VTOL had caught the attention of an old automated Wraith. We needed to find another way.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_supertree_was_co_0","vox_zbio_13_02_000_plyz");//The supertree was collapsing, the only safe route to the docks was up.
    dialog::add("plyz_chatter_confirmed_th_0","vox_zbio_13_03_000_plyz");//Chatter confirmed the 54 Immortals were scrambling to get out of the Biodomes through the swamps.
