    dialog::add("plyz_getting_to_the_safeh_0","vox_zven_1_01_000_plyz");//Getting to the safehouse wouldn't be easy. Under the influence of Goh Xiulan the undead had spread well beyond the wall -- but they weren't our only threat.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_vultures_sadist_0","vox_zven_2_01_000_plyz");//The Vultures, sadistic scavengers ravaged by atrocity and time, driven by fear and insanity. We saw their victims strung up on display the moment we arrived.
    dialog::add("salm_when_forced_against_0","vox_zven_2_01_001_salm");//When forced against a wall the impurities of man can be revealed.
    dialog::add("plyz_this_was_more_than_i_0","vox_zven_2_01_002_plyz");//It was more than that, this was survivalism. When only one percent of the world's population is human, you either died and became the undead, or you survived by preying on the living.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_had_a_bad_feeling_0","vox_zven_3_01_000_plyz");//I had a bad feeling about this. Going through the undead was one thing, but Vultures... they were fucking savages.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_vultures_of_sing_0","vox_zven_4_01_000_plyz");//These scavengers were well equipped. I suppose that's what you get when you prey on your fellow man.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_d_need_to_take_th_0","vox_zven_4_01_001_plyz");//We made quick work of them.
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_took_point_0","vox_zven_5_01_000_plyz");//Hendricks took point down the alley, from the sounds of it the dead knew we were coming. (wry) Clearly Singapore was happy to have us back in town.
    dialog::add("plyz_overwatch_confirmed_0","vox_zven_6_01_000_plyz");//Overwatch confirmed the Vultures were converging on the safehouse. Civilian spotted on site. We didn't know if we could get through without additional collateral damage.
    dialog::add("salm_curious_the_vultu_0","vox_zven_7_01_000_salm");//Curious... the Vultures' behavior: willing to kill the living and dead alike without prejudice.  (beat) Survival of the Fittest at its most primal, they act with reckless abandon thinking without consequence. They had to know, the more they killed other humans the slimmer their chances became...
    dialog::add("plyz_don_t_think_of_them_0","vox_zven_7_01_001_plyz");//Don't think of them as humans: they're animals. Abandoned by any form of governing body they dictated their own society. They were tribal. Nomadic. In their eyes man was as much a threat as the undead.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_scavengers_began_0","vox_zven_7_01_002_plyz");//The scavengers began realizing they weren't the only humans in the area. It was a matter of time before Goh Xiulan knew we were here.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_safehouse_was_be_0","vox_zven_8_01_000_plyz");//The safehouse was beyond the Gardens, but the Gardens belonged to the dead. They smelled us lurking above.
    dialog::add("plyz_vultures_ahead_had_a_0","vox_zven_9_01_000_plyz");//Before Hendricks could take him out the scavenger alerted Goh Xiulan. She knew we were here. Reinforcements were moving on a checkpoint nearby... along with more dead.
    dialog::add("salm_what_was_the_purpose_0","vox_zven_9_01_001_salm");//Why did they create these displays? What was the purpose?
    dialog::add("plyz_territorial_vulture_0","vox_zven_9_01_002_plyz");//They weren't just displays -- they were “art”. (beat) All way to show off their work. Lure their enemies with the dead bodies of friends. Vultures are territorial. They fought among themselves, sociopaths at war with everyone and everything. Undead or fellow human -- either way you were a predator competing over the same resources.  (beat) And now we we'd become prey baited into a trap.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_vultures_beat_us_0","vox_zven_10_01_000_plyz");//The Vultures beat us there, set fire to the facility. Goh Xiulan announced herself over a PA -- she was inside... and she had a “special guest” waiting for us.
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_didn_t_thi_0","vox_zven_10_01_002_plyz");//Hendricks thought we should stand down, it wasn't worth it.
    dialog::add("salm_but_you_pushed_back_0","vox_zven_10_01_003_salm");//But you pushed back?
    dialog::add("plyz_we_needed_that_dossi_0","vox_zven_10_01_004_plyz");//We needed that dossier. At this point, it was our only lead to Deimos.  (beat) I told Hendricks to call in exfil, I'd take the safehouse. Bishop had told us the document was hidden in the panic room within the facility.
    dialog::add("plyz_a_malfunctioning_a_s_0","vox_zven_10_01_005_plyz");//A malfunctioning A.S.P. heard the commotion and joined the party. I needed to find a rocket launcher.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_cleared_the_plaza_0","vox_zven_10_01_006_plyz");//We cleared the plaza, all that was left was to get inside--
    dialog::add("plyz_the_blast_knocked_us_0","vox_zven_10_01_007_plyz");//The blast knocked us back. We heard the building creaking, it could collapse at any moment.
    dialog::add("salm_who_did_you_find_in_0","vox_zven_11_01_000_salm");//Who was in the panic room?
    dialog::add("plyz_her_our_guardian_0","vox_zven_11_01_001_plyz");//...her. Kane. Our Guardian Angel.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_had_no_idea_what_s_0","vox_zven_11_01_002_plyz");//Someone had beaten the hell outta her.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_didn_t_have_to_wa_0","vox_zven_11_01_003_plyz");//I wouldn't wait long to find out who.
    dialog::add("plyz_goh_xiulan_we_later_0","vox_zven_11_01_004_plyz");//Goh Xiulan. She was there for the same thing I was... the same thing our friend was. The dossier.
    dialog::add("plyz_and_somehow_she_d_re_0","vox_zven_11_01_005_plyz");//And somehow Kane had clearly pissed Goh Xiulan off.
    dialog::add("plyz_with_goh_xiulan_take_0","vox_zven_11_01_006_plyz");//I quickly freed Kane. We had to get the hell outta there.
    dialog::add("salm_and_the_file_on_deim_0","vox_zven_11_01_007_salm");//And the file on Deimos?
    dialog::add("plyz_most_likely_it_was_r_0","vox_zven_11_01_008_plyz");//Most likely it was reduced to kindle. Gone. Or so we thought.
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_got_our_tr_0","vox_zven_12_01_000_plyz");//Hendricks called in transport, Singapore was another dead end.
    dialog::add("plyz_but_we_needed_a_few_0","vox_zven_12_01_001_plyz");//But we needed a few answers from Kane, starting with who the hell she was -- and what she was doing in an abandoned CIA safehouse.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_truth_proved_mor_0","vox_zven_12_01_002_plyz");//The truth proved more eye-opening than we could've imagined...
    dialog::add("salm_did_you_kill_her_0","vox_zven_11_02_000_salm");//Did you kill her?
    dialog::add("dolo_do_it_kill_her_kil_0","vox_zven_11_02_001_dolo");//Do it. Kill her. Kill his host. Prove yourself worthy.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_struggled_pani_0","vox_zven_11_02_002_plyz");//I... struggled, panicked. I acted in the heat of the moment.
