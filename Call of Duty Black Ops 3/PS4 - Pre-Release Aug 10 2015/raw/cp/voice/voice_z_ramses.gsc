{

    dialog::add("plyz_the_pieces_were_comi_0","vox_zram_1_01_000_plyz");//The pieces were coming together. Virus 61-15, Taylor's team, the undead, it all came back to Deimos. All we needed was you.
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_was_unhing_0","vox_zram_1_01_001_plyz");//Hendricks was unhinged. The idea his friends betrayed mankind to help a demi-god...the concept alone was insane, let alone his friends involvement.
    dialog::add("plyz_kane_came_with_she_0","vox_zram_1_01_002_plyz");//Kane was in it to the end. By now she was as obsessed with stopping Deimos as we were.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_weren_t_ready_for_0","vox_zram_1_01_003_plyz");//We weren't ready for Cairo, no matter what we thought.
    dialog::add("plyz_this_place_if_the_0","vox_zram_1_01_004_plyz");//This place... if there was ever a place that was hell on earth, this was it.
    dialog::add("plyz_you_certainly_weren_0","vox_zram_2_01_000_plyz");//You certainly weren't too happy to see us.
    dialog::add("salm_you_say_it_like_i_ha_0","vox_zram_2_01_001_salm");//You say it like I had a choice in the matter.
    dialog::add("plyz_with_no_time_we_nee_0","vox_zram_2_01_002_plyz");//With no time, we needed you to be willing to talk...
    dialog::add("plyz_the_truth_serum_w_0","vox_zram_2_01_003_plyz");//...the truth serum would make you relax, more willing to divulge. Hendricks told us to take a walk.
    dialog::add("plyz_he_asked_about_taylo_0","vox_zram_2_01_004_plyz");//He asked about Taylor and Deimos, he wanted you to connect the dots.
    dialog::add("salm_and_i_told_him_as_i_0","vox_zram_2_01_005_salm");//And I told him Deimos controlled them. Your friend Bishop was correct, there was a 'Brain' manipulating the undead. It was Deimos. Deimos realized he could access a person's DNI, he could possess them, inhabit them, consume them. He didn't need to turn them.
    dialog::add("plyz_like_puppets_on_stri_0","vox_zram_2_01_006_plyz");//Like puppets on strings.
    dialog::add("salm_the_undead_are_mindl_0","vox_zram_2_01_007_salm");//The undead are mindless creatures. But Taylor's team, Goh Xiulan, anyone with DNI... they could be hosts. They were slaves to do his bidding.
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_wanted_to_0","vox_zram_2_01_008_plyz");//Hendricks wanted to know why. We both did.
    dialog::add("salm_for_many_years_i_had_0","vox_zram_2_01_009_salm");//For many years I had studied Deimos and his dimension, Malum, a place of unspeakable evil.
    dialog::add("salm_but_he_had_been_pull_0","vox_zram_2_01_010_salm");//He had been pulled to Earth, yanked from his existence by accident. Trapped here, he saw opportunity: to enslave humanity and use them to wage an unholy war against Dolos.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_demigoddess_his_0","vox_zram_2_01_011_plyz");//The demigoddess. His sister... (realizing) That was it? We were, we were just a chess piece? Our entire existence was just--
    dialog::add("salm_a_pawn_in_a_much_lar_0","vox_zram_2_01_012_salm");//A pawn in a much larger game in a universe far bigger than you realize. Humanity is anthill. Deimos and Dolos are two children fighting over the magnifying glass. (beat) But Hendricks was desperate. He wanted to know how to kill Deimos.
    dialog::add("plyz_you_you_told_him_0","vox_zram_2_01_013_plyz");//You... you told him he couldn't.
    dialog::add("salm_how_does_one_kill_a_0","vox_zram_2_01_014_salm");//How does one kill a god? You can't. The only way to defeat him, the only way to sever his control over the undead, for Bishop's serum to work and save humanity was to send him back to Malum.
    dialog::add("plyz_is_to_open_the_ga_0","vox_zram_2_01_017_plyz");//...is to open the gateway.
    dialog::add("salm_as_we_are_doing_now_0","vox_zram_2_01_018_salm");//As we are doing now, by walking through your memories.
    dialog::add("salm_but_hendricks_hen_0","vox_zram_2_01_019_salm");//But Hendricks... Hendricks was not happy with this answer.
    dialog::add("hend_and_as_it_was_he_wa_0","vox_zram_2_01_020_hend");//And as it was, he was out of time.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_assault_on_ramse_0","vox_zram_3_01_000_plyz");//The assault on Ramses was beginning.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_didn_t_have_time_0","vox_zram_3_01_001_plyz");//The base was about to be overrun -- and we owed Khalil that favor. (beat) Time to take the fight to the dead.
    dialog::add("plyz_it_was_a_simple_str_0","vox_zram_4_01_000_plyz");//It was a simple, straight forward plan, except--
    dialog::add("plyz_something_knocked_ou_0","vox_zram_4_01_001_plyz");//Our VTOL was shot out of the sky. The mobile blockade fell early.
    dialog::add("plyz_cairo_she_was_a_cit_0","vox_zram_4_01_002_plyz");//Cairo. She was a city on fire. Except for the Egyptian Army and a smattering of civilians hidden away i... she'd fallen to the dead.
    dialog::add("plyz_our_triggerman_got_h_0","vox_zram_5_01_000_plyz");//Our triggerman got hit. I had to get up there and detonate.
    dialog::add("plyz_khalil_thanked_us_0","vox_zram_6_01_000_plyz");//Khalil thanked us... he thought they still had a chance... They had no idea what was about to happen.
    dialog::add("plyz_egyptian_army_comman_0","vox_zram_6_01_001_plyz");//Egyptian Army command came over comms, a scavenger had blown a hole through Safiya Square and the Undead were pouring through, headed for Ramses. I told Khalil we'd take care of the Square.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_gave_hendricks_a_h_0","vox_zram_7_01_001_plyz");//I gave Hendricks a hand opening the VTOL hatch. I heard screams, there was someone still alive.
    dialog::add("salm_you_went_in_to_save_0","vox_zram_7_01_002_salm");//You went in to save this man? The odds of his survival could not have been great. You yourself said no one was getting out alive.
    dialog::add("plyz_does_that_matter_0","vox_zram_7_01_003_plyz");//Does that matter?
    dialog::add("plyz_we_d_cleared_the_pla_0","vox_zram_8_01_000_plyz");//We'd cleared the plaza, but something was wrong... I could hear it.
    dialog::add("salm_what_did_you_hear_1","vox_zram_8_01_001_salm");//What did you hear?
    dialog::add("plyz_nothing_and_that_wa_0","vox_zram_8_01_002_plyz");//Nothing. And that was the problem. (beat) It took us a moment to realize what had happened.
    dialog::add("plyz_something_had_taken_0","vox_zram_8_01_003_plyz");//Something had taken out the DEAD system. One of the scavengers, maybe a malfunctioning biped.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_saw_reinforcement_0","vox_zram_8_01_004_plyz");//We saw reinforcements fly in, but it was too late. Khalil tried to reach Egyptian Command, all we heard were screams. Ramses Station had fallen to the dead.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_got_out_of_the_op_0","vox_zram_8_01_005_plyz");//We got out of the open. Khalil... he'd reached the breaking point.
    dialog::add("plyz_it_wasn_t_just_the_c_0","vox_zram_1_02_000_plyz");//It wasn't just the city, the entirety of northern Africa had fallen to the undead. The walls were covered with memories of the dead, those taken by 61-15, lost to this wasteland, the desert for the undead.
    dialog::add("plyz_between_the_flesh_ea_0","vox_zram_1_02_001_plyz");//It was the last place on Earth you'd want to be. But you chose to hide there, why?
    dialog::add("salm_for_that_very_reason_0","vox_zram_1_02_002_salm");//For that very reason. I hoped no one would come for me.
    dialog::add("plyz_why_what_were_you_r_0","vox_zram_1_02_003_plyz");//Why? What were you running from?
    dialog::add("salm_from_the_creature_yo_0","vox_zram_1_02_004_salm");//From what you sought: Deimos.
    dialog::add("plyz_he_didn_t_say_it_bu_0","vox_zram_3_02_001_plyz");//He didn't say it, but I could hear it in his voice: Khalil knew this was the last stand. If they lost this battle they'd lose the city. (beat) We followed him.
    dialog::add("plyz_turns_out_it_wasn_t_0","vox_zram_4_02_000_plyz");//It wasn't just the undead gunning for us.
    dialog::add("plyz_cairo_was_no_man_s_l_0","vox_zram_4_02_001_plyz");//Cairo was no man's land, filled with the undead, rogue robotics, and scavengers -- they were all converging on our position.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_put_him_in_his_pla_0","vox_zram_4_02_002_plyz");//If we were gonna pull this off we didn't have time to fuck around.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_grabbed_the_spike_0","vox_zram_4_02_003_plyz");//I grabbed the Spike Launcher and told Kane at HQ to locate the support columns for us to blow.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_detonated_the_las_0","vox_zram_4_02_004_plyz");//We detonated the last support column. We had to get back behind the wall so we could blow the street.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_told_hendricks_i_n_0","vox_zram_5_02_000_plyz");//I told Hendricks I needed a moment--
    dialog::add("plyz_good_thing_hendricks_0","vox_zram_5_02_001_plyz");//Good thing Hendricks still had our back.
    dialog::add("plyz_there_were_so_few_of_0","vox_zram_7_02_000_plyz");//I guess it was Khalil who changed my mind. There were so few of us left, if there was a chance, any chance...
    dialog::add("plyz_i_d_take_it_0","vox_zram_7_02_001_plyz");//I'd take it.
    dialog::add("plyz_he_pulled_his_piece_0","vox_zram_7_02_002_plyz");//He pulled his piece on us, thought we were undead. I talked him down.
    dialog::add("salm_strange_even_with_0","vox_zram_7_02_003_salm");//Strange... even with all odds stacked against you, you tried to help this man.
    dialog::add("salm_he_clung_to_life_wit_0","vox_zram_7_02_004_salm");//He clung to life without hope and still you tried to save him.
    dialog::add("plyz_turns_out_it_didn_t_0","vox_zram_7_02_005_plyz");//Turns out it didn't matter.
    dialog::add("plyz_he_didn_t_survive_th_0","vox_zram_7_02_006_plyz");//He didn't survive. It would only be a matter of time before he turned and joined the horde.  (beat) No time to stop and mourn. If I did that I'd end up joining him. And we weren't going down just yet.
    dialog::add("plyz_and_there_it_was_th_0","vox_zram_8_02_001_plyz");//No mistaking that look. That look of defeat. Anger. Frustration. Hopelessness. You try to sympathize, you try to comfort, doesn't matter.
    dialog::add("plyz_kane_came_over_comms_0","vox_zram_8_02_002_plyz");//Then Kane came over comms, she'd picked up the location of Sarah Hall, another of Taylor's team. Her signal popped back up on the grid. We had traced her to Kebechet, the sandy ruins of Cairo's Garden City.
    dialog::add("plyz_khalil_agreed_to_com_0","vox_zram_8_02_003_plyz");//Khalil agreed to come with us.
    dialog::add("salm_and_hendricks_0","vox_zram_8_02_004_salm");//And Hendricks?
    dialog::add("plyz_his_mind_was_melting_0","vox_zram_8_02_005_plyz");//His mind was melting. I still didn't know what was sparking his behavior. He didn't want to go after Hall. I said he didn't have a say in the matter.
    dialog::add("plyz_he_didn_t_like_that_0","vox_zram_8_02_006_plyz");//He didn't like that.
    dialog::add("salm_he_attacked_you_0","vox_zram_8_02_007_salm");//He attacked you?
    dialog::add("plyz_i_told_you_it_wasn_0","vox_zram_8_02_008_plyz");//I told you, it wasn't him. It was that look in his eyes. Like Goh Xiulan. Like Maretti. Like Diaz.
    dialog::add("plyz_but_for_a_moment_his_0","vox_zram_8_02_009_plyz");//But for a moment his eyes cleared. He saw clarity. And I saw him.
    dialog::add("salm_what_did_he_say_0","vox_zram_8_02_010_salm");//What did he say to you?
    dialog::add("dolo_salim_lies_0","vox_zram_8_02_011_dolo");//Salim... lies.
    dialog::add("plyz_he_didn_t_think_open_0","vox_zram_8_02_012_plyz");//He didn't think opening the portal would save us, it would destroy us. The last time it opened evil came through, why would this time be different? (beat) He said Deimos was trying to trick us. He said you were lying to us.
    dialog::add("plyz_are_you_0","vox_zram_8_02_013_plyz");//...are you?
    dialog::add("plyz_we_weren_t_ready_for_1","vox_zram_3_03_000_plyz");//We weren't ready for the station assault. I don't know how the dead got in, maybe an abandoned tunnel, an infected civilian, or maybe the Vultures let them through, but at the end of the day it didn't matter. (beat) Egyptian Army came over comms -- they'd never seen a horde this size move on the station.  (beat) If we had any chance to stop them, we needed to reinforce the eastern checkpoint, a narrow passageway the dead would need to traverse to reach Ramses.
    dialog::add("plyz_safiya_square_was_a_0","vox_zram_7_03_000_plyz");//Safiya square was a total SNAFU. Undead, rogue robotics, Everything and the kitchen sink wanted a piece of us.
    dialog::add("plyz_it_didn_t_take_long_0","vox_zram_7_03_001_plyz");//It didn't take long for the Vultures to drop a second ASP in the area.
    dialog::add("plyz_it_was_only_a_matter_0","vox_zram_7_03_002_plyz");//It was only a matter of time before a malfunctioning ASP arrived, ready to take out everyone and everything.
    dialog::add("salm_why_didn_t_he_want_t_0","vox_zram_8_03_000_salm");//Why didn't he want to go after Hall?
    dialog::add("plyz_he_was_done_he_was_0","vox_zram_8_03_001_plyz");//He was done. He was hanging on by a thread. Two of our friends dead, another on the chopping block.
    dialog::add("plyz_he_wasn_t_buying_thi_0","vox_zram_8_03_002_plyz");//He wasn't buying this interdimensional bullshit, and why should he?
    dialog::add("plyz_he_wasn_t_buying_thi_1","vox_zram_8_03_003_plyz");//He wasn't buying this interdimensional insanity and why should he?
    dialog::add("salm_well_why_did_you_0","vox_zram_8_03_004_salm");//Well, why did you?
    dialog::add("plyz_i_needed_i_needed_0","vox_zram_8_03_005_plyz");//I needed... I needed some way to explain what was happening. Separate fact from fiction. Truth from lies.
    dialog::add("plyz_khalil_was_waiting_0","vox_zram_1_04_000_plyz");//Khalil was waiting. He was holding you in an interrogation room.
    dialog::add("salm_how_was_khalil_happ_0","vox_zram_1_04_001_salm");//How was Khalil? Happy to see you?
    dialog::add("plyz_it_wasn_t_a_warm_wel_0","vox_zram_1_04_002_plyz");//It wasn't a warm welcome. As far as he was concerned we owed him one for grabbing you. More than a few men gave their lives to bring you in. He hoped it was worth it.
    dialog::add("salm_he_was_angry_0","vox_zram_1_04_003_salm");//He was angry?
    dialog::add("plyz_he_was_tired_tired_0","vox_zram_1_04_004_plyz");//He was tired. Tired of fighting a losing battle. Khalil was a realist, he'd fight to the death for country, but he knew what was coming.
    dialog::add("salm_what_was_coming_0","vox_zram_1_04_005_salm");//What was coming?
    dialog::add("plyz_extinction_beat_0","vox_zram_1_05_000_plyz");//Extinction.  (beat) The Undead changed everything. The NRC were hit first and hardest, we saw that in Ethiopia.  (beat) The damage done by the dead didn't even take into account what the Water Wars did, when the continent dried up and the Nile River Coalition took war to Egypt over the Nile, the last water supply. They were so busy fighting they didn't realize it too had dried up. (beat) But the rise of the undead... How do you fight an enemy that doesn't need water?
    dialog::add("plyz_khalil_s_rage_wasn_t_0","vox_zram_1_05_001_plyz");//Khalil's rage wasn't misplaced. It wasn't personal... he just was barely holding on.
    dialog::add("salm_what_did_you_hope_to_0","vox_zram_1_05_002_salm");//What did you hope to learn from speaking to me?
    dialog::add("plyz_how_to_stop_deimos_0","vox_zram_1_05_003_plyz");//How to stop Deimos. Everyone has a weakness.
    dialog::add("plyz_kane_asked_what_was_0","vox_zram_1_05_004_plyz");//The whole base was on edge, you could feel it in the air.
    dialog::add("salm_what_was_happening_0","vox_zram_1_05_005_salm");//What was happening?
    dialog::add("plyz_the_dead_were_moving_0","vox_zram_1_05_006_plyz");//The dead were moving on Ramses, an assault was imminent. Khalil didn't know how much time we had with you.
    dialog::add("plyz_that_set_hendricks_o_0","vox_zram_1_05_007_plyz");//Hendricks demanded to know why we weren't informed.
    dialog::add("salm_how_did_khalil_respo_0","vox_zram_1_05_008_salm");//How did Khalil respond to his anger?
    dialog::add("plyz_wa_command_was_down_0","vox_zram_1_05_009_plyz");//WA Command was down, how was he meant to get his message through? (beat) Besides, they still had their DEAD system. They used to knock enemy aircraft out of the sky, but now they were used to eviscerate the undead. If any came too close the laser cannons would take them out.
    dialog::add("plyz_for_as_absurd_as_thi_0","vox_zram_1_05_010_plyz");//For as absurd as this shit was with other dimensions, supreme beings, an army of the undead, I'm willing to bet even gods aren't invulnerable.
    dialog::add("plyz_khalil_led_us_to_int_0","vox_zram_1_06_000_plyz");//Khalil led us to interrogation. He warned us our time was limited, no telling when the dead might attack.
    dialog::add("plyz_but_if_we_could_get_0","vox_zram_1_06_001_plyz");//But if we could get answers out of you... maybe we could find a way to fight back.
