    dialog::add("plyz_a_woman_a_guardian_0","vox_zaqu_2_01_012_plyz");//A Guardian Angel. Someone watching over me. My Support Detail. She got through somehow... and pulled me out. She brought me back from the brink.
    dialog::add("plyz_she_said_my_work_was_0","vox_zaqu_2_01_013_plyz");//She said it wasn't my time, my work wasn't done. I had to stop Taylor. I don't know how she knew, it didn't make any sense...

    dialog::add("plyz_no_i_d_never_see_0","vox_zaqu_2_01_015_plyz");//...no. I'd never worked with her before today.

    dialog::add("salm_you_mention_your_dni_0","vox_zaqu_2_01_023_salm");//You mention your DNI systems glitch... but you pulled yourself out. Your support detail, this 'Guardian Angel'... she didn't save you. She didn't even join you on the way to the control center. (beat) You were suffocating under the water, your systems were failing... hallucinations in the wake of trauma is not uncommon...
    dialog::add("plyz_i_did_not_make_her_u_0","vox_zaqu_2_01_024_plyz");//I did not make her up, I didn't fucking imagine her.
    dialog::add("plyz_with_their_comms_jam_0","vox_zaqu_2_01_026_plyz");//With their comms jammed the next step was to breach the control room to take back the facility. There was access ahead, I just needed to get through the flooded room in front of me. (beat) Our Support Detail insisted on coming with.
    dialog::add("dolo_go_with_her_trust_h_0","vox_zaqu_3_01_001_dolo");//Listen to her. Trust her. Find Taylor.
    dialog::add("salm_what_happened_when_y_1","vox_zaqu_4_01_000_salm");//You cornered him. What did Maretti say?

    dialog::add("plyz_it_was_the_second_ti_0","vox_zaqu_4_01_003_plyz");//Deimos. He said if I wanted answers, I had to find Damien Bishop; a man we both knew from a past mission. Bishop could help stop Deimos.  (beat) But first I had to kill him.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_did_what_we_were_t_0","vox_zaqu_5_01_000_plyz");//I killed him as he asked. I did our job. It didn't sit with Hendricks.

    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_was_pissed_0","vox_zaqu_5_01_002_plyz");//Hendricks was pissed because Maretti was our link to finding Taylor, a link I'd just severed and split open on a spike.
    dialog::add("plyz_what_i_channeled_inw_0","vox_zaqu_5_01_003_plyz");//And the guilt I carried all those years, that I channeled inward? Hendricks channeled outward. At me.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_knocked_some_sense_0","vox_zaqu_5_01_004_plyz");//I knocked some sense into him.
    dialog::add("plyz_sometimes_it_was_the_0","vox_zaqu_5_01_005_plyz");//Sometimes it was the only way to get through.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_told_him_what_mare_0","vox_zaqu_5_01_006_plyz");//I told him what Maretti had told me. About Bishop, Deimos, whoever the hell he was.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_d_figure_this_shi_0","vox_zaqu_5_01_007_plyz");//But we'd figure this shit out. And we'd do it together.
    dialog::add("plyz_but_right_then_we_ha_0","vox_zaqu_5_01_008_plyz");//But right then we had bigger problems.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_egyptian_army_co_0","vox_zaqu_5_01_009_plyz");//The Egyptian Army couldn't hold the refinery. Plan 'Bomb-this-Shithole-to-Hell' was a go.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_lost_taylor_but_0","vox_zaqu_5_01_010_plyz");//We lost Taylor, but we had a lead. Maretti said Bishop could help us find Deimos. Which meant he was our next stop...
    dialog::add("plyz_he_kept_saying_this_0","vox_zaqu_6_01_000_plyz");//He kept saying 'this isn't me, this isn't me'. He kept saying Deimos made him do it.

    dialog::add("plyz_this_was_our_chance_1","vox_zaqu_7_01_000_plyz");//This was our chance to fix our mistake and I fucked that up.
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_said_i_may_0","vox_zaqu_7_01_001_plyz");//Hendricks said I may as well have damned the world myself. I'd had enough.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_mention_of_bisho_0","vox_zaqu_7_01_002_plyz");//The mention of Bishop got Hendricks' attention. Last we saw him was back in '65, ten years ago in Ethiopia. How Bishop knew Deimos we hadn't a clue.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_had_to_get_out_of_0","vox_zaqu_7_01_003_plyz");//We had to get out of there. Now.
    dialog::add("plyz_our_target_was_a_cot_0","vox_zaqu_1_02_000_plyz");//Our target was a Cotardist Colongy. They'd taken over a Refinery and were a well-armed facility,  protecting them and the dead they worshipped. Top priority was to cut off their comms and leave them in the dark, but first we had to clear out their defenses.
    dialog::add("plyz_this_was_a_routine_s_0","vox_zaqu_1_02_001_plyz");//This was a routine sweep. Every time another sympathizer colony sprouted up we'd squash it back down. As far as we were concerned we were doing the world a favor.
    dialog::add("plyz_when_khalil_took_the_0","vox_zaqu_3_02_000_plyz");//When Khalil took the control room he found something on the security footage. Something we needed to see.

    dialog::add("plyz_it_was_like_seeing_a_0","vox_zaqu_3_02_002_plyz");//Like seeing a Ghost, we... we just stumbled upon him. This wasn't just a Cotardists Colony. This was Taylor's hideout.
    dialog::add("plyz_command_informed_us_0","vox_zaqu_3_02_005_plyz");//It was too late for Taylor, the Cotardists put him on a VTOL. We'd go after Maretti. Command informed us the Kill Order was still active. Hendricks didn't like that, but it wasn't his call.
    dialog::add("salm_how_did_you_feel_abo_0","vox_zaqu_3_02_006_salm");//How did you feel about it?
    dialog::add("plyz_five_years_five_y_0","vox_zaqu_3_02_007_plyz");//Five years... Five years after our fuck-up and we could fix it. I'd gladly take the shot.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_regrouped_with_ou_0","vox_zaqu_4_02_000_plyz");//We regrouped with our allies. That's Egyptian Army Lieutenant Zeyad Khalil, friend of ours. He was durable, seasoned; he defended his home through Undead Wars, he wouldn't go down without a fight.
    dialog::add("salm_what_was_the_plan_0","vox_zaqu_4_02_001_salm");//What was the plan?
    dialog::add("plyz_khalil_would_move_on_0","vox_zaqu_4_02_002_plyz");//Khalil would move on control from the exterior. I'd sweep the dead from the air. Our Guardian Angel accompanied me. She... she told me the answer to finding Taylor was on this refinery. Why she thought that... how she knew that... it was surreal.
    dialog::add("salm_uncanny_even_0","vox_zaqu_4_02_003_salm");//Uncanny, even?
    dialog::add("plyz_maretti_had_locked_h_0","vox_zaqu_5_02_000_plyz");//Maretti had locked himself in the security room. Only way in was to cut the power. To do that, we had to overload the generators.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_moved_on_the_arra_0","vox_zaqu_1_03_000_plyz");//We moved on the array. But the Undead sympathizers weren't going down without a fight.
    dialog::add("plyz_disabling_the_comms_0","vox_zaqu_1_03_001_plyz");//Disabling the comms would take some time. Our Support Detail dealt with that, I dealt with reinforcements.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_station_disabled_0","vox_zaqu_1_03_002_plyz");//The station disabled, we had to get back to our bird.
    dialog::add("salm_what_happened_with_h_0","vox_zaqu_3_03_000_salm");//How was Hendricks coping with the change of plans?
    dialog::add("plyz_he_was_upset_and_wh_0","vox_zaqu_3_03_001_plyz");//He was upset, and why wouldn't he be? Command wanted our friends dead. He wanted to bring Maretti in alive.

    dialog::add("plyz_no_hendricks_hen_0","vox_zaqu_3_03_003_plyz");//No, Hendricks... Hendricks had been different since Singapore.
    dialog::add("salm_in_what_way_0","vox_zaqu_3_03_004_salm");//In what way?
    dialog::add("plyz_in_every_way_aggres_0","vox_zaqu_3_03_005_plyz");//Every way. Aggressive. Angry. He was losing perspective... and there... something was just off. (frustrated) I should've known what happened.
    dialog::add("salm_how_could_you_have_k_0","vox_zaqu_3_03_006_salm");//How could you have known? Even if you had, what could you have done?You seem so certain of his intentions.
    dialog::add("plyz_listen_doc_if_we_0","vox_zaqu_3_03_009_plyz");//We all battle inner demons and our choices. Hendricks, Taylor... that whole team rose the ranks together. Fought alongside each other. Friends. (beat) Little did we know one of his 'friends' was watching us...
    dialog::add("plyz_they_were_already_ev_0","vox_zaqu_4_03_000_plyz");//They were already evacuating Taylor. We locked down the facility, separating Taylor and his associate Maretti.
    dialog::add("salm_who_did_you_go_after_0","vox_zaqu_4_03_001_salm");//Who did you go after?
    dialog::add("plyz_it_was_too_late_for_0","vox_zaqu_4_03_002_plyz");//It was too late for Taylor, the Cotardists put him on a VTOL. We'd go after Maretti. Command informed us the Kill Order was still active. Hendricks didn't like that, but it wasn't his call.
    dialog::add("salm_how_did_you_feel_abo_1","vox_zaqu_4_03_003_salm");//How did you feel about it?
    dialog::add("plyz_the_array_was_ahead_0","vox_zaqu_1_04_000_plyz");//The array was ahead. Bring it down, we'd be one step closer to eradicating this colony.
    dialog::add("plyz_our_support_detail_n_0","vox_zaqu_1_04_001_plyz");//Our Support Detail needed a few moments to disable the array. Lucky for me, I had more hostiles to keep me occupied.
    dialog::add("plyz_with_the_comms_disab_0","vox_zaqu_1_04_002_plyz");//With the comms disabled, we needed to get back in the air.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_don_t_remember_why_0","vox_zaqu_3_04_000_plyz");//I don't remember why I left her off the report, but she. Was. There.
    dialog::add("salm_did_she_have_a_name_0","vox_zaqu_3_04_001_salm");//Did she have a name?
    dialog::add("plyz_of_course_she_had_a_0","vox_zaqu_3_04_002_plyz");//Of course she had a fucking name.
    dialog::add("plyz_of_course_she_had_a_1","vox_zaqu_3_04_003_plyz");//Of course she had a name.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_guardian_angel_0","vox_zaqu_3_04_004_plyz");//The Guardian Angel, she said... she said her name was Kane. She told me she'd help me get through this.
    dialog::add("salm_looking_at_her_now_0","vox_zaqu_3_04_005_salm");//Looking at her now, she seems afraid... As if your death would impact her, like you meant something to her. As if she knew you.
    dialog::add("plyz_look_i_understand_h_0","vox_zaqu_3_04_006_plyz");//Look, I understand how it sounds, alright? I get it. You're the doctor, but she was as real as you or me. How she knew what she knew... I don't know.  (beat) And that's not the point. Point is if she hadn't been there, I'd be at the bottom of that flooded hallway, only thing left of me would be an empty vessel, abandoned and forgotten to the dead long ago.
    dialog::add("plyz_she_said_we_had_to_m_0","vox_zaqu_3_04_007_plyz");//She said we had to move. Control was beyond a server room ahead, if we were going to take the refinery from these Dead Sympathizers, we needed to clear it out. If we couldn't it would be on to Plan B.
    dialog::add("salm_plan_b_0","vox_zaqu_3_04_008_salm");//Plan B?
    dialog::add("plyz_plan_bomb_this_shit_0","vox_zaqu_3_04_009_plyz");//Plan 'Bomb-this-Shithole-to-Hell'.

    dialog::add("plyz_maretti_was_just_bel_0","vox_zaqu_4_04_000_plyz");//Maretti was just below us. If we were gonna get him, we'd need to take a shortcut.
    dialog::add("salm_shortcut_0","vox_zaqu_4_04_001_salm");//Shortcut?
    dialog::add("plyz_a_leap_of_faith_0","vox_zaqu_4_04_002_plyz");//A Leap of faith.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_prepped_to_breach_0","vox_zaqu_3_05_000_plyz");//We prepped to breach... but it turns out our enemies planned ahead.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_explosion_blocke_0","vox_zaqu_3_05_001_plyz");//The explosion blocked our path, we had to double-back. It caught us off guard... But the noise also caught the undead's attention.
