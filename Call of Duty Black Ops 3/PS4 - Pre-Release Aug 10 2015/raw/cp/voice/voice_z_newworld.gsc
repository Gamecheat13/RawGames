    dialog::add("plyz_taylor_he_told_us_t_0","vox_znew_2_01_002_plyz");//Taylor. He told me they'd received a tip about the Cotardists. These Undead-Sympathizers had sprung up around the globe in the years following the outbreak, they believed the Undead were the 'next step' in human evolution. To become Undead was to live. The Dead should inherit the earth. Crazy right?
    dialog::add("salm_who_s_that_with_tayl_0","vox_znew_2_01_005_salm");//Was it only Taylor? Was there anyone else?
    dialog::add("plyz_that_s_sebastian_dia_0","vox_znew_2_01_006_plyz");//Sebastian Diaz.

    dialog::add("plyz_yeah_but_that_was_0","vox_znew_2_01_008_plyz");//Back then he was Taylor's Second in Command. He would take point on the raid. Hostile encounters were expected with the Undead, but that didn't seem to bother him.
    dialog::add("plyz_they_were_so_relaxed_0","vox_znew_2_01_010_plyz");//They were so relaxed. The Dead threatened Zurich... they were fearless.  (beat) Didn't take away our own fears.
    dialog::add("salm_why_not_did_you_not_0","vox_znew_2_01_011_salm");//Why didn't it? You were a Deadkiller, a Berserker: you sought and relished the slaughter.
    dialog::add("plyz_no_not_yet_with_th_0","vox_znew_2_01_012_plyz");//I wasn't one just yet. With the outbreak at the factory my training was cut short.
    dialog::add("plyz_if_we_were_gonna_lea_0","vox_znew_2_01_013_plyz");//If I was gonna learn my shit, it would be on the job. This Mission was my Training.

    dialog::add("salm_it_s_a_lapse_your_m_0","vox_znew_3_01_008_salm");//It's a lapse. Your mind is wandering into the unknown, your subconscious is finding fears, dreams, doubts. Stay with me. Stay with my voice.
    dialog::add("salm_you_were_saying_the_0","vox_znew_3_01_009_salm");//You're still in the Factory. You were about to make a discovery.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_i_diaz_told_0","vox_znew_4_01_000_plyz");//We... I... yes, there was a console ahead. Diaz told me to interface to get access to their network. We had to find out what they were planning.

    dialog::add("plyz_no_nothing_can_re_0","vox_znew_4_01_003_plyz");//No... nothing can really prepare you for it. The flood of data, endless streams of infinite information. It's instantaneous and it's an eternity.
    dialog::add("salm_what_did_it_show_you_0","vox_znew_4_01_004_salm");//What did it show you?
    dialog::add("plyz_the_cotardists_had_a_1","vox_znew_4_01_005_plyz");//The Cotardists had a Contact. An Inside Man at Coalescence World Headquarters in Zurich. We had his address, ID number, security details... the last of which was most telling.

    dialog::add("plyz_he_had_extensive_sec_0","vox_znew_4_01_007_plyz");//He had extensive security clearance at Coalescence. Specifically, he had access to 61-15, the Virus.

    dialog::add("plyz_no_but_they_had_eno_0","vox_znew_4_01_010_plyz");//No. But whatever it was it didn't bode too well if you wanted to stay human. We had to find him.
    dialog::add("salm_then_let_s_find_him_0","vox_znew_4_01_011_salm");//Then let's do just that, let's find him. Take me to his apartment.
    dialog::add("salm_we_don_t_need_every_0","vox_znew_4_01_012_salm");//We don't need every memory to create the bridge to the truth -- just the critical ones.

    dialog::add("plyz_our_mark_was_bleedin_0","vox_znew_9_01_001_plyz");//Our Mark was bleeding out after that fall through the ceiling. Time wasn't on our side and we needed information.

    dialog::add("plyz_we_did_what_hendrick_0","vox_znew_9_01_003_plyz");//I would do what Hendricks did in Coalescence. I had to interfaced with him, extract the information from his memories.
    dialog::add("salm_you_make_it_sound_co_0","vox_znew_9_01_004_salm");//You make it sound cold. You would be diving into this man's mind. A dangerous task. A terminal task.
    dialog::add("plyz_you_have_to_make_it_0","vox_znew_9_01_005_plyz");//I know, but you have to make it cold. Detach yourself from the person. It was our first time performing this sort of interface, and Hall wanted to get that point across above all else: It's nothing personal because there is no person. They're not humans. They're databanks for pilfering.
    dialog::add("salm_even_though_it_would_0","vox_znew_9_01_006_salm");//Even though it would kill him.
    dialog::add("plyz_even_though_beat_0","vox_znew_9_01_007_plyz");//Even though... (beat) It's ironic, really.

    dialog::add("plyz_hall_standing_there_0","vox_znew_9_01_009_plyz");//Hall teaching me how to raid a person's mind. It wouldn't be long before... well, we know what happens to Hall. What I do to Hall.
    dialog::add("plyz_but_we_do_what_we_ha_0","vox_znew_9_01_010_plyz");//But we do what we have to do. This was the world we made. If we don't do it, if we can't sacrifice the individual... How do we protect everyone else?
    dialog::add("salm_it_s_strange_to_be_i_0","vox_znew_9_01_012_salm");//It's strange to be inside someone's mind, no? You witness the facts and the fiction. Information versus imagination...
    dialog::add("salm_that_s_a_heavy_burde_0","vox_znew_9_01_013_salm");//That's a heavy burden to press upon the individual.
    dialog::add("plyz_if_not_us_than_who_0","vox_znew_9_01_014_plyz");//If not us than who? This was what it was about, being part of an Undead Extermination Team. Being a Deadkiller. It's about making that sacrifice -- making the ultimate sacrifice.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_tunnels_we_tr_0","vox_znew_10_01_000_plyz");//The tunnels... We tracked down the Cotardist's operations, and they were putting up a good fight.
    dialog::add("salm_who_joined_you_in_th_0","vox_znew_10_01_001_salm");//Who joined you in the tunnels?
    dialog::add("plyz_taylor_and_peter_0","vox_znew_10_01_002_plyz");//Taylor oversaw the operation, but the lead on this was Peter Maretti, the last of Taylor's team. An explosives expert.
    dialog::add("plyz_and_a_self_proclaime_0","vox_znew_10_01_003_plyz");//He was the guy you wanted when you needed to blow shit up.  (beat) He was damn good at blowing shit up, which made him perfect for the fight ahead.
    dialog::add("plyz_well_if_it_wasn_t_f_0","vox_znew_10_01_005_plyz");//Fearing discovery the Cotardist collective had an armada of Undead and Patrolling Robotics guarding the facility. (struggles) I won't lie it's strange seeing Maretti like this. Knowing what happens next: He was crucial to finding Taylor, to finding Deimos.
    dialog::add("salm_at_the_abandoned_ref_0","vox_znew_10_01_006_salm");//You mean the Refineries in Cairo?
    dialog::add("plyz_he_had_a_pivotal_par_0","vox_znew_10_01_008_plyz");//He had a pivotal part to play, he just didn't know it yet.
    dialog::add("plyz_he_knew_the_way_to_t_0","vox_znew_10_01_012_plyz");//What he knew then was the way to the hideout. He took point.

    dialog::add("plyz_taylor_said_there_wa_0","vox_znew_13_01_003_plyz");//Taylor said there wasn't much time. (beat) But I'd done good. For all the “on-the-job” training I'd been through, I'd done alright for myself.  (beat) All that was left was to find the train...
    dialog::add("plyz_wait_what_s_this_w_0","vox_znew_17_01_000_plyz");//Wait. What's happening?? I said I turned out alright, what is this place?? Where am I?
    dialog::add("plyz_dr_salim_what_am_i_0","vox_znew_17_01_001_plyz");//Dr. Salim, what am I seeing?? (we see Taylor) Taylor?? Why can't I move??
    dialog::add("salm_your_mind_is_trying_0","vox_znew_17_01_002_salm");//Your mind is trying to reject the truth. This isn't real.
    dialog::add("plyz_no_no_no_no_i_re_0","vox_znew_17_01_003_plyz");//No. No, no, no. I remember this place. What are they doing to me?

    dialog::add("plyz_snow_country_s_0","vox_znew_1_02_000_plyz");//I see... the city. I'm heading toward downtown Zurich.
    dialog::add("salm_what_about_taylor_0","vox_znew_1_02_001_salm");//And Taylor?
    dialog::add("plyz_that_s_him_commande_0","vox_znew_1_02_002_plyz");//That's him. Commander John Taylor. The first Deadkiller.Calm. Cool. The definition of determination. I was a rookie then, fresh blood.  (beat) There weren't many of us, there were rumors about our division than actual recruits.  (beat) They said we were engineered to be immune to 61-15, that we couldn't get infected. Supposedly we were manics, thirsty to maim the undead. Some of that was true. (beat) They compared us to Viking Beserkers, we sought the slaughter and relished it. I kinda liked the ring of that.
    dialog::add("plyz_it_was_our_first_mis_0","vox_znew_1_02_003_plyz");//Yes. Five years after the outbreak, most cities had at least one containment zone, but Zurich managed to stay outbreak free. Now someone wanted to change that.
    dialog::add("plyz_this_this_is_wron_0","vox_znew_1_02_004_plyz");//Wait.. this... this feels wrong. This can't be right, this can't be real. Can you feel that? This feels... unnatural. How are you doing this?
    dialog::add("salm_i_m_not_doing_anythi_0","vox_znew_1_02_006_salm");//I'm not doing anything. This is your mind. I'm the passenger, you're the pilot.  (beat) But tell me -- do you remember the train exploding?

    dialog::add("plyz_dr_salim_what_0","vox_znew_1_02_008_plyz");//...Dr. Salim?? What's happening? What's going on??
    dialog::add("salm_it_isn_t_it_s_your_0","vox_znew_1_02_009_salm");//You must be calm. This is your memory and you dictate the truth, but your mind can play tricks on you. It can deceive you... and it can lie.
    dialog::add("plyz_what_do_you_mean_li_0","vox_znew_1_02_010_plyz");//What do you mean, lie? The explosion, the train, this...
    dialog::add("salm_this_never_happened_0","vox_znew_1_02_011_salm");//This never happened, but it nearly did. You and Taylor stopped it.
    dialog::add("plyz_then_what_the_hell_a_0","vox_znew_1_02_012_plyz");//How can I see something that never happened? What the hell am I seeing?... and why does it feel so damn real?
    dialog::add("salm_the_human_mind_is_fr_0","vox_znew_1_02_013_salm");//The human mind is fragile, easily swayed by an incorrect recounting of events. This was one outcome your mind feared.
    dialog::add("plyz_so_what_do_i_do_how_0","vox_znew_1_02_014_plyz");//So what do I do? How do I fix it?
    dialog::add("salm_start_from_the_begin_0","vox_znew_1_02_015_salm");//Start from the beginning and take me through the mission. Once we organize everything correctly, we'll be able to find the truth. (beat) Tell me about the Raid...
    dialog::add("salm_this_was_your_first_0","vox_znew_1_02_016_salm");//This was your first mission?
    dialog::add("plyz_what_are_these_drops_0","vox_znew_2_02_000_plyz");//What are these drops I keep seeing? I saw them in Coalescence, too.
    dialog::add("salm_it_s_your_mind_tryin_0","vox_znew_2_02_001_salm");//It's your mind trying to help you through your memories. Weapons, abilities, powers -- use them or don't, but they may offer you a temporary advantage.  (beat) Where did Diaz take you next?
    dialog::add("plyz_we_still_have_to_get_0","vox_znew_2_02_002_plyz");//We still have to get the factory entrance.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_entrance_was_loc_0","vox_znew_3_02_000_plyz");//The entrance was locked, we had to destroy a generator to get it open. That was around the corner... with more dead standing in our way.  (beat) I had an arsenal in front of me, but Diaz made it clear -- he told me to run point on the ground. He was curious to see me think on my feet.
    dialog::add("salm_in_a_way_he_was_acti_0","vox_znew_3_02_001_salm");//In a way he was acting as your training.
    dialog::add("plyz_diaz_wanted_to_see_m_0","vox_znew_3_02_002_plyz");//Diaz wanted to see me earn the name Deadkiller -- and there's really only one way you can do that.  (beat) I had support that day, but when you're out there in the real world, you're on your own. No back-up. No reinforcements. Just you and the undead. I'd show him I was worthy of the name.
    dialog::add("plyz_he_was_ready_0","vox_znew_5_02_000_plyz");//He was ready.
    dialog::add("salm_but_it_wasn_t_just_y_0","vox_znew_5_02_001_salm");//Remember: walk before you run. You weren't alone. Who else was there? Taylor?
    dialog::add("plyz_taylor_no_taylor_0","vox_znew_5_02_002_plyz");//Taylor... yes, he discovered our Mark had just unleashed the virus into  Old Town, turning civilians into the living dead. But Taylor didn't lead that day, no, he had overwatch, he was our eyes in the sky. Sarah Hall, however--
    dialog::add("plyz_sarah_hall_was_with_0","vox_znew_5_02_003_plyz");//Sarah Hall the team's intelligence expert, was with me. She had point. She found our mark, apparently his supply of 61-15 was ten times what we initially believed. Enough to turn all of Zurich into a City of the Dead.
    dialog::add("plyz_she_d_been_with_tayl_0","vox_znew_5_02_004_plyz");//Hall had been with Taylor as long as Diaz. He practically raised her, trained her -- he made her.
    dialog::add("plyz_today_john_taylor_wa_0","vox_znew_5_02_005_plyz");//With Taylor in the sky Hall was our feet on the ground. She didn't have as much patient for fresh blood as Diaz. She was direct and focused. Right now she was about to give me a lesson in target acquirement.
    dialog::add("plyz_and_she_was_about_to_0","vox_znew_5_02_007_plyz");//She told me not to slow her down. Failing this 'lesson' would prove deadly. No back-up. Just us. Just as Deadkillers do. (beat) I'd need to keep up.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_had_to_get_after_h_0","vox_znew_5_02_008_plyz");//I had to get after him, our Mark was going to release 61-15 into the surrounding area--
    dialog::add("salm_what_did_you_find_w_0","vox_znew_9_02_000_salm");//What did you find? What secrets did your 'databank' have to share?
    dialog::add("salm_good_you_didn_t_eve_0","vox_znew_14_02_000_salm");//Good. You didn't even need my push to the final memory. You connected events and arrived at the truth.
    dialog::add("plyz_now_what_happens_0","vox_znew_14_02_001_plyz");//Now what happens?
    dialog::add("salm_now_we_set_things_ri_0","vox_znew_14_02_002_salm");//Now we set things right. Through your mind, you realign the events as they occurred.
    dialog::add("plyz_and_by_doing_this_0","vox_znew_14_02_003_plyz");//And by doing this... if I work with you and remember the events leading up to Zurich...?
    dialog::add("salm_you_ll_be_able_to_op_0","vox_znew_14_02_004_salm");//You'll be able to open the gateway.  (beat) But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's finish here first.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_found_the_bomb_car_0","vox_znew_16_02_000_plyz");//I found the bomb car. The whole thing was wired up, primed to blow.
    dialog::add("plyz_i_i_see_him_but_0","vox_znew_16_02_001_plyz");//I... I see him, but that's not right, Taylor wasn't there, I was alone. I was on my own.
    dialog::add("plyz_there_there_wasn_0","vox_znew_16_02_002_plyz");//There... there wasn't time. I couldn't disarm it.
    dialog::add("salm_so_what_did_you_do_1","vox_znew_16_02_003_salm");//So what did you do?
    dialog::add("plyz_remember_how_we_can_0","vox_znew_16_02_004_plyz");//Remember how we can't get infected? Some of the rumors about us were true. That's why I was there. Why we make the sacrifice. I used my cybernetic abilities to reversed the polarity of the train car and detached it. The car unleashed the gas... but safely outside the city.
    dialog::add("salm_and_you_lived_0","vox_znew_16_02_005_salm");//And you lived?
    dialog::add("plyz_i_didn_t_know_i_d_ma_0","vox_znew_16_02_006_plyz");//I didn't know I'd make it at the time, but I turned out alright.  (beat) It wasn't the last time I cheated death.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_cotardist_base_o_0","vox_znew_3_03_000_plyz");//The Cotardist base of operations was just ahead. Once we were inside we'd be able to figure out what they were planning.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_cotardist_group_0","vox_znew_9_03_000_plyz");//The Cotardist Group had set up shop deep in the subways. Whatever they were planning, the answers were there.
    dialog::add("salm_information_that_wou_0","vox_znew_9_03_001_salm");//Information that would to stop the bomb. Save millions of lives. The Greater Good.
    dialog::add("plyz_yeah_the_greater_0","vox_znew_9_03_002_plyz");//...yeah. The greater good... (beat) Taylor joined us. If we were going to move on the subway, we had to act fast. The attack, whatever it was, was imminent.
    dialog::add("salm_let_s_move_on_to_the_0","vox_znew_9_03_004_salm");//Let's move on to the tunnels...
    dialog::add("salm_and_your_mark_what_0","vox_znew_9_04_000_salm");//And your Mark? What happened to him after your interface?
    dialog::add("plyz_he_was_gone_dead_0","vox_znew_9_04_001_plyz");//He was gone. Dead.
