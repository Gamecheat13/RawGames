    dialog::add("plyz_the_singapore_quaran_0","vox_zbla_1_01_000_plyz");//The Singapore Quarantine Zone. We never thought we'd be back here.
    dialog::add("salm_bad_memories_0","vox_zbla_1_01_001_salm");//Bad memories?
    dialog::add("plyz_you_know_damn_well_i_0","vox_zbla_1_01_002_plyz");//You know damn well it certainly wasn't good ones, doc. The place was a living, breathing reminder of the incident five years ago.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_d_be_in_and_out_q_0","vox_zbla_1_01_003_plyz");//We'd be in and out quick. We weren't staying any longer than we had to.
    dialog::add("plyz_find_out_who_this_de_0","vox_zbla_1_01_004_plyz");//Find out who this Deimos asshole was and get the hell outta dodge.
    dialog::add("plyz_for_security_purpose_0","vox_zbla_2_01_000_plyz");//Kane said data drive on Deimos was encrypted and separated into two pieces. We needed both to access the drive. Like a lock and key.
    dialog::add("salm_the_lock_i_assume_w_0","vox_zbla_2_01_001_salm");//The lock, I assume was at the Black Station. Where was the key?
    dialog::add("plyz_the_key_that_was_0","vox_zbla_2_01_002_plyz");//The Key... that was down by the docks. Undead central, heavy hostiles. We brought a DNI-Equipped  Micro-Missile Launcher. Couldn't be too careful. (beat) That and Command had prepped a drone strike to wipe out most of the dock, but with the high winds from the incoming superstorm... well, no guarantees it'd work. We grabbed our spike anchors in case we needed to be nailed down.
    dialog::add("plyz_wa_command_had_prepp_0","vox_zbla_2_01_003_plyz");//That and Command had prepped a drone strike to wipe out most of the dock, but with the high winds from the incoming superstorm... well, no guarantees it'd work. We grabbed our spike anchors in case we needed to be nailed down.
    dialog::add("plyz_after_the_docks_our_0","vox_zbla_2_01_004_plyz");//After the docks our rendezvous with Kane was set for abandoned police station. (beat) Hendricks took point.
    dialog::add("salm_more_vultures_0","vox_zbla_3_01_000_salm");//More Vultures?
    dialog::add("plyz_praying_on_the_weak_0","vox_zbla_3_01_001_plyz");//Praying on the weak. Since the fall of the Immortals they'd inherited all of Singapore, turned the place into some twisted version of the wild west.
    dialog::add("plyz_after_the_safehouse_0","vox_zbla_3_01_002_plyz");//After the events at the Safehouse we caught their attention. They weren't exactly thrilled with us on their turf and were taking it out on the locals to find us.
    dialog::add("salm_why_didn_t_you_step_0","vox_zbla_3_01_003_salm");//Why didn't you step in? You could've saved them.
    dialog::add("plyz_calculated_risks_we_0","vox_zbla_3_01_004_plyz");//Calculated Risks. We needed to stay quiet and lay low.
    dialog::add("salm_but_there_s_always_a_0","vox_zbla_3_01_005_salm");//But there's always a chance, isn't there?
    dialog::add("plyz_chance_is_a_billion_0","vox_zbla_3_01_006_plyz");//Chance is a billion-sided die. You like the odds of that? If they didn't die today they'd die tomorrow. If not tomorrow, the day after. One way or another, death was coming for all of us, nobody was getting out alive.  (beat) If we tried to save them it could be our necks in those collars. We weren't there to save two people, we were there save all the rest of us. We needed to get to the Black Station raising as little alarm as possible. Last thing we needed were the dead and Vultures after our throats. (beat) Turns out the odds were already against us.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_winds_were_picki_0","vox_zbla_5_01_000_plyz");//The winds were picking up, the superstorm could hit any moment. Good thing we grabbed those spike anchors. We were gonna need 'em.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_plan_was_to_wait_0","vox_zbla_6_01_000_plyz");//The plan was to wait on the drone strike. Once it did it's part we'd move in.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_missiles_were_in_0","vox_zbla_6_01_001_plyz");//The missiles were ineffective, the wind too strong.  (beat) And now that ocean liner looked like it was about to rip free. That thing would pulverize the dock -- taking the data drive with it.
    dialog::add("plyz_hendricks_said_fuck_0","vox_zbla_6_01_002_plyz");//Hendricks said 'fuck it'. We were built to kill the dead, no reason to switch it up now.
    dialog::add("plyz_but_of_course_the_su_0","vox_zbla_7_01_000_plyz");//But of course the superstorm hit sooner than expected.
    dialog::add("plyz_the_barge_ripped_fre_0","vox_zbla_7_01_001_plyz");//The barge ripped free and barreled toward us. (beat) We had to think quick.
    dialog::add("plyz_and_hang_on_for_dear_0","vox_zbla_7_01_002_plyz");//And hang on for dear life.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_d_been_set_to_ren_0","vox_zbla_8_01_000_plyz");//We'd been set to rendezvous at an abandoned police station, but we were off-route.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_cut_through_the_f_0","vox_zbla_8_01_001_plyz");//We cut through the flooded subway to save time.
    dialog::add("plyz_turns_out_we_weren_t_0","vox_zbla_10_01_001_plyz");//Turns out we weren't the only living things in there.
    dialog::add("plyz_kane_made_quick_work_0","vox_zbla_10_01_002_plyz");//But Kane did her part to make sure that didn't happen.
    dialog::add("salm_she_was_well_trained_0","vox_zbla_10_01_003_salm");//She was well-trained... was she CIA? Winslow Accord?
    dialog::add("plyz_it_didn_t_matter_sh_0","vox_zbla_10_01_004_plyz");//She... was just someone who was always in the right place at the right time. (beat) Before we could move on the Black Station, we had other problems.
    dialog::add("plyz_with_the_dead_cleare_0","vox_zbla_10_01_005_plyz");//With the dead cleared out we moved toward our rendezvous.
    dialog::add("salm_what_had_gone_wrong_0","vox_zbla_11_01_000_salm");//What had gone wrong?
    dialog::add("plyz_we_hadn_t_taken_the_0","vox_zbla_11_01_001_plyz");//We hadn't taken the scavengers into account. They'd figured out they had Deadkillers in their midst.  (beat) Kane told us they had a comms relay ahead, if we scramble them it could lead the Vultures away from the Black Station. At least long enough for us to get what we needed.
    dialog::add("salm_but_kane_was_resourc_0","vox_zbla_11_01_002_plyz");//Well, what did I tell you? Thing about Deadkillers is there's always a Plan B. You don't create the problems just the solutions. You adapt to what's thrown at you.
    dialog::add("plyz_we_d_regroup_with_he_0","vox_zbla_11_01_004_plyz");//We'd regroup with her outside of Chinatown.
    dialog::add("salm_adapt_or_die_0","vox_zbla_11_01_005_salm");//Adapt or die.
    dialog::add("plyz_yeah_adapt_or_die_0","vox_zbla_11_01_006_plyz");//Yeah... adapt or die.
    dialog::add("salm_so_much_for_maintain_0","vox_zbla_11_01_007_salm");//So much for maintaining a low profile, I suppose.
    dialog::add("plyz_by_the_time_we_rende_0","vox_zbla_13_01_000_plyz");//By the time we rendezvoused with Kane the dead were crawling all over the street.
    dialog::add("salm_what_was_kane_s_plan_0","vox_zbla_13_01_001_salm");//What was Kane's plan?
    dialog::add("plyz_hit_em_in_the_gulle_0","vox_zbla_13_01_002_plyz");//Hit 'em in the gullet then bag and tag. Gotta admit, the girl wasn't afraid of a fight. She seemed to welcome it. Relish it.
    dialog::add("salm_like_yourself_0","vox_zbla_13_01_003_salm");//Like yourself?
    dialog::add("plyz_like_a_berserker_li_0","vox_zbla_13_01_004_plyz");//Like a Berserker. Like a Deadkiller.

    dialog::add("plyz_slaughtered_cia_staf_0","vox_zbla_15_01_001_plyz");//Slaughtered CIA staff. We weren't the only ones looking for the data drives.

    dialog::add("plyz_we_found_a_dossie_0","vox_zbla_15_01_004_plyz");//We found a dossier, a diary, really, a living testament of what happened fifteen years ago and in the years since. (beat) It explained Project Corvus -- a CIA mind control experiment. These scientists had combined two ancient Biochemical Compounds. Nova 6... and something called Element 115.
    dialog::add("plyz_they_fused_them_toge_0","vox_zbla_15_01_005_plyz");//They fused them together, created a chemical cocktail and injected it through their test subject's DNI. They wanted to control them.
    dialog::add("salm_control_them_0","vox_zbla_15_01_006_salm");//Control them?
    dialog::add("plyz_those_corpses_below_0","vox_zbla_15_01_007_plyz");//Those corpses, below Coalescence in Project Corvus, they weren't patients. They were prisoners, the criminally insane. The scientists believed they could make them well again. Make people better.

    dialog::add("plyz_the_gateway_to_malum_0","vox_zbla_15_01_009_plyz");//A Gateway to Malum, another dimension filled with absolute evil.  (beat) It sounds crazy, even saying it now, but they opened it not realizing what they'd done. And they let him through.

    dialog::add("plyz_deimos_someone_did_0","vox_zbla_15_01_011_plyz");//Deimos. Demigod of Dread and terror. He caused the Coalescence Disaster, unleashed 61-15 upon Earth, creating the undead that roamed the earth.  (can't comprehend) There were details on Taylor's team. They... they were working for Deimos, helped him trigger Armageddon
    dialog::add("plyz_there_was_also_infor_0","vox_zbla_15_01_012_plyz");//There was also information on his sister.

    dialog::add("plyz_a_vulture_got_the_dr_0","vox_zbla_10_02_000_plyz");//A Vulture got the drop on us, determined to reduce us to scrap metal. He'd hit a big payday with us cornered.

    dialog::add("plyz_maybe_in_2070_when_w_0","vox_zbla_10_02_004_plyz");//Maybe in 2070 when we were the saviors of mankind then. By 2075 everybody wanted a piece of us. This guy would've gotten his share, too...
