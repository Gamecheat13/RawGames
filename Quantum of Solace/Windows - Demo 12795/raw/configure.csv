# The file is broken into the CPU section followed by the GPU section.,,,,,
"# The first two columns of the CPU section must be ""cpu mhz"" then ""sys mb"".,,,,,"
"# The first column of the GPU section must be ""gpu"".  This triggers the start of the GPU section.,,,,,"
# Each subsequent column header in both sections is a dvar name.,,,,,
# In the CPU section, each dvar gets the value listed in its column for the row of the system settings that most closely match the current machine, without going over,,,,,
# In the GPU section, each dvar gets the value listed in its column for the row of the first GPU string to match.,,,,,
# For GPU names, spaces are treated as wildcards that match any sequence of 0 or more non-numeric characters.  You can use * to match 0 or more of any character, or ? to match any single character.,,,,,
